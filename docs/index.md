# Naomi's Example Code

Welcome to my example code website!

This website isn't really designed to be browsed - you'll find no navigation. It's really here so I can reference specific examples and instructions I frequently write when helping people learn to code.

If you _really_ want to browse this stuff, you can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/naomi-lgbt/examples).
